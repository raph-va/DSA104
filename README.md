# DSA104
Repository for the course DSA104 AI and ML in Chemistry. All course material will be shared here. Additionally, organisational information will be uploaded as well to OLAT, which will also be used for all course-related communication.

## Prerequisites
This course utilises several tools, which have to be installed on your PC (if you have done the DSA103, you are already well set):

1) Git/Github: Make sure you have Git installed and a GitHub account
2) We will use the package manager uv and its virtual environment (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
3) IDE: For running code and Jupyter notebooks and for facilitating version control, we will be using an IDE. All demonstration will be done in Visual Studio Code, but other development environments, such as Pycharm, work as well. Whatever IDE you are using, make sure that you keep it and its extensions (e.g. for Jupyter) up to date and that you are familiar with the working environment.
